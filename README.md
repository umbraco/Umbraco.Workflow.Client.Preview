# Umbraco.Workflow.Client.Preview

It's exactly that - a preview of the client-side assets for Umbraco Workflow, due to land in Umbraco 14.

This is a snapshot repository and will be updated weekly (or more or less frequently :)) with the latest progress from the Workflow 14 build.

It is not a working repository, so pull requests will most likely not be merged. However, we absolutely encourage questions and discussion - Bellissima comes with a learning curve, and we're all at different places on that curve, so let's share what we know, and query what we don't.

Given this is only the front-end of Workflow, it's not going to do much if you clone and try to build. The intention here is very much to share our progress, patterns and ideas, and help to kickstart your Bellissima journey.

So dig in, start exploring, let us know what we could do differently or better, and ask questions when things are obscure or unclear.

Adios, AngularJs.
